    			<p>Usually our programs are based on a specific venue such as Le Mans, Gippy Groovers or the AFL.</p>
    			<p>When you sign up to an activity, we will arrange transport to pick you up and drop you back where you started. If this isnâ€™t possible for any reason, a pick up location is arranged at the most convenient spot for you.</p>
