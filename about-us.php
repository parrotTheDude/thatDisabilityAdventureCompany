    			<h2>Why are we different?</h2>
    			<p>With the average age of our support workers being 25, we believe having a young team of dedicated support workers is what sets us apart from other disability agencies.</p>
    			<p>Our focus is fun. We want everyone who comes on board with us to have the best time and come away from every adventure feeling more confident in themselves and their abilities.</p>
