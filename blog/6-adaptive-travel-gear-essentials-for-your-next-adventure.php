              <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Rugged terrain, beaches, hiking trails</p>
              <p>Standard mobility devices can struggle on rough paths, sand, or muddy areas. That’s where all-terrain wheelchairs come in. Models like the Hippocampe or Magic Mobility Extreme X8 are built for adventure—with features like fat tyres, suspension, and lightweight frames.</p>

              <h2>5. Compression Bags & Adaptive Packing Tools</h2>
              <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Packing efficiently, maximising independence</p>
              <p>Packing can be a challenge when mobility is limited or luggage space is tight. Compression bags (like those from Sea to Summit) allow you to pack clothing compactly and stay organised, while adaptive tools—like grabbers or zipper pulls—can make dressing and unpacking easier.</p>
              <p>Look for bags with wide openings, colour-coded compartments, and tactile labels. If you're travelling with a support worker, shared checklists are also a great way to pack and prepare together.</p>
              <h3>Why we love them:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Saves space and weight</li>
                <li>Promotes independence in packing/unpacking</li>
                <li>Reduces reliance on others during travel</li>
                <li>Budget-friendly and easy to find</li>

              <h2>6. Sensory-Friendly Travel Aids for Autism and Non-Physical Disabilities</h2>
              <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Travellers with autism, ADHD, anxiety, or sensory sensitivities</p>
              <p>Not all disabilities are visible, and sensory overload can be one of the biggest barriers to travel for neurodivergent adventurers. The good news? A few well-chosen items can dramatically improve comfort, safety, and confidence.</p>
              <p><a class="articleLink" href="https://au.loopearplugs.com/products/engage?variant=47951757541714&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_id=22036904858&utm_campaign=&utm_content=&utm_term=&gadid=&cq_src=google_ads&cq_cmp=22036904858&cq_con=&cq_term=&cq_med=pla&cq_plac=&cq_net=x&cq_plt=gp&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22036915433&gbraid=0AAAAACj0PVxEbmoNLY6HC_APXbcyjrAP-&gclid=Cj0KCQjwgvnCBhCqARIsADBLZoK1LUYIljOvfe7UfUH8FHGqqUL3cd26udC2Ezt09xqrzT3lWOZzKtgaAkMDEALw_wcB">Loop Earplugs - Engage 2</a> are a game-changer in busy or unpredictable environments—unlike headphones, they are subtle to wear, offering discreet relief from everyday noise for more clear and focused conversations. They block background noise and keep speech clear, allowing you to connect at your own volume for happier socializing.</p>
              <p>Additionally, fidget tools <a class="articleLink" href="https://kaikofidgets.com/collections/hand-fidget-range">(such as Kaiko Fidgets)</a>, weighted lap pads, and compression vests can provide grounding during travel, while visual schedules or social stories (printable or app-based) help with transitions and reduce anxiety around unfamiliar routines.</p>
              <p>You can also tailor your sensory kit to your own individual needs, including your favourite snacks, textures, or preferred calming activities.</p>
              <h3>Why we love them:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Promotes calm and self-regulation</li>
                <li>Supports independence and emotional wellbeing</li>
                <li>Easy to personalise for different needs</li>
