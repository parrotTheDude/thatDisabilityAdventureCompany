              <p>Don’t confuse us with visas – we are That Disability Adventure Company (TDAC Australia), and we’re changing the lives of those with mild to moderate disabilities through accessible adventures and support.</p>

              <h2>TDAC: Not a Visa—A Life-Changing Disability Support Company</h2>
              <p>We’ve always dreamt of TDAC going viral—and thanks to the new Thailand TDAC visa, it has, but not quite how we hoped for. While the TDAC visa is making waves in the world of international travel, it’s drowning us out.</p>
              <p>So here we are to set the record straight: We’re not a visa. We’re That Disability Adventure Company (TDAC Australia), and we are dedicated to changing the lives of those with disabilities through our adventures and support.</p>
              <p>We’re a disability support company based in Victoria, Australia, offering inclusive day programs, one-on-one support, and overnight stays for people with mild to moderate disabilities. Our mission is simple but powerful: to create unforgettable, empowering experiences and connections.</p>

              <h2>Who We Are</h2>
              <p>At That Disability Adventure Company (TDAC Australia), we’re a close-knit group of passionate young adults who believe in doing disability support differently.</p>
              <p>Our team is made up of vibrant, motivated support workers—the average age is just 25—who bring energy, creativity, and a whole lot of heart to every activity. We’re not just carers; we’re companions, motivators, and adventure buddies.</p>
              <p>We’ve built our programs around fun, confidence-building, and real connection, because we believe support services should be as exciting and empowering as they are practical.</p>
              <p>Whether it’s a day in the city or a weekend getaway, our goal is to help each participant grow their independence while having an amazing time.</p>

                <li>Recurring weekly programs that build life skills through familiarity and structure.</li>
                <li>Group activities and one-on-one support designed to foster friendships and confidence.</li>
                <li>Life skill workshops focused on independence and personal growth.</li>

              <h2>Why Names Matter – And Why Ours Stands Out</h2>
              <p>We know the name “TDAC” might now bring up links to immigration paperwork and visa requirements—but let’s not let this overshadow our amazing work!</p>
              <p>At That Disability Adventure Company, TDAC stands for something way more meaningful: inclusion, empowerment, friendship, growth, and most of all—adventure.</p>
              <p>We’re proud to share the acronym, because every click and search gives us the chance to tell the world who we really are; a community-based organisation committed to fun disability support in Victoria, Australia.</p>
