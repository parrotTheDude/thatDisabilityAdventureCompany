              <h2>What Is a Support Worker Agency and How Does It Work?</h2>
              <p>A support worker agency is an organization that connects individuals or families with trained support workers. Agencies offer a range of services, including:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Care:</strong> Assistance with bathing, dressing, and hygiene.</li>
                <li><strong>Domestic Support:</strong> Help with household tasks like cleaning and laundry.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Access:</strong> Support to participate in social and community activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Mental Health and Behavioral Support:</strong> Assistance with managing mental health needs and behaviors.</li>
                <li><strong>Respite Care:</strong> Temporary support to give primary caregivers a break.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In short, a support worker agency acts as a bridge between people needing support and professionals ready to help.</p>
