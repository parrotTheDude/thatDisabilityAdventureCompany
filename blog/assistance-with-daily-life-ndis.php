			                    <p>If you are living with mild to moderate disabilities, gaining independence and managing everyday activities can sometimes require extra help. The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) has a support category called ‘Assistance with Daily Life’ that provides funding for a range of disability support services, including one-to-one support. This is designed to help you live as independently as possible, whether at home or in the community.</p>

			                    <h2>What is NDIS Assistance with Daily Life?</h2>
			                    <p>NDIS Assistance with Daily Life is a budget area that falls under NDIS Core Support and covers activities that support daily living, such as:</p>
			                    <ul>
			                        <li><strong>Personal Care:</strong> Assistance with dressing, bathing, grooming, and cleaning.</li>
			                        <li><strong>Household Tasks:</strong> Help with cooking, cleaning, laundry, and gardening.</li>
			                        <li><strong>Meal Preparation:</strong> Maintaining a healthy diet by assisting with grocery shopping and cooking meals.</li>
			                        <li><strong>Transport Assistance:</strong> Getting to medical appointments, social events, or community activities.</li>
			                        <li><strong>Medication Management:</strong> Taking prescribed medications on time.</li>
			                        <li><strong>Skill Development:</strong> Improving the ability to complete daily living tasks independently.</li>
			                    </ul>

			                    <h2>What Is Not Covered: Managing Daily Living Expenses</h2>
			                    <p>NDIS support with daily living does not cover general daily living expenses such as rent, food, or entertainment. However, it can be used to fund support services that help you perform daily tasks. For example, while the NDIS won’t pay for your groceries, it can fund a support worker to help you shop and prepare meals.</p>

			                <section class="paragraphSection">
			                    <h2>One-to-One Support</h2>
			                    <p>The NDIS provides funding for one-to-one support under the Assistance with Daily Life budget as long as this support is helping develop daily life skills, such as those listed above. Therefore, NDIS funding can be used to hire support workers through disability support services, such as <a class="articleLink" href="https://thatdisabilityadventurecompany.com.au/">TDAC</a>, that offer <a class="articleLink" href="https://thatdisabilityadventurecompany.com.au/one-to-one">one-to-one support programs.</a></p>

			                    <p>These one-to-one programs involve a dedicated support worker coaching and assisting with daily living tasks. Since the programs are one-to-one, they will be tailored to your unique needs, helping you perform essential activities while promoting independence and quality of life. <a class="articleLink" href="https://thatdisabilityadventurecompany.com.au/contact"> Think one-to-one support could be for you?

			                    <h2>How One-to-One Sessions Can Support Independent Living</h2>
			                    <p>For many, one-to-one support is a crucial step in achieving independent living. By receiving personalized assistance, you can develop your daily routine, engage with your community, and acquire the skills needed to live independently.</p>
