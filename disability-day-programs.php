							<h2>What Activities Are Included in Day Programs?</h2>
					    <p>The heart of any great program lies in its activities. Day programs for adults with disabilities provide many fun and useful activities. These programs aim to meet the different needs of each participant.</p>
					    <p>Skill Development Workshops are a key component, teaching practical skills like meal preparation, financial management, and gardening. These activities empower participants to take charge of their daily lives and build confidence in their abilities.</p>
					    <p>Fun activities like sports, group games, and fitness sessions help people stay active and healthy. They also provide fun and enjoyment.</p>
					    <p>Creative Arts sessions offer a way for people to express themselves. Participants can explore art, music, and drama in a friendly environment.</p>
